Description:
    -This codebase generates any specificed number of random 3D creatures that contain eight 1 x 1 x 1 blocks
    -These creatures are then simulated, and evolved to mutate in both phenotype and genotype
    -The creatures that move farthest in the positive x direction are selected to evolve their children in the next generation
    -The overall fittest creature from any generation is then simulated in pyrosim, and revealed to the user.
How to operate:
    -Simply open main.py, and click run to activate the evolutionary simulation. The rest of the code will work its magic!
