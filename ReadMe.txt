-This codebase generates a random 3D creature, by running the "main.py" file.
-The creature can be anywhere from 5 to 15 blocks in length
-Blocks can generate in any direction, allowing for the creature's 3D shape.
    -To accomplish this, a random number is generated, from that value a direction is picked
    -Then, the blocks coordinates are set according to its respective direction, and the joint is connected to the next block
-The brain is created to assign a motor neuron to every block, and send sensor neurons to a random number of blocks in the creature
-Blocks with sensor neurons are tagged green, while blocks without are tagged blue.
